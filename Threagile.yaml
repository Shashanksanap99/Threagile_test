          title: Unauthorized Access to Public Subnet
          type: unauthorized_access
          details: |
            Unauthorized users may access the public subnet, potentially leading to unauthorized access to resources within the subnet.
          data_breach:
            risk: low
            impact: |
              Limited unauthorized access to public resources may not result in a data breach.

          title: Misconfiguration in Security Groups
          type: misconfiguration
          details: |
            Security groups misconfigurations may lead to unauthorized access to resources within the public subnet.
          data_breach:
            risk: medium
            impact: |
              An unauthorized access vulnerability could potentially result in a data breach, depending on the nature of the compromised resource.
