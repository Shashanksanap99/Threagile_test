abuse_cases:
  Denial-of-Service: >
    As a hacker I want to disturb the functionality of the backend system in order to cause indirect
    financial damage via unusable features.
  CPU-Cycle Theft: >
    As a hacker I want to steal CPU cycles in order to transform them into money via installed crypto currency miners.
  Ransomware: >
    As a hacker I want to encrypt the storage and file systems in order to demand ransom.
  Identity Theft: >
    As a hacker I want to steal identity data in order to reuse credentials and/or keys on other targets of the same company or outside.
  PII Theft: >
    As a hacker I want to steal PII (Personally Identifiable Information) data in order to blackmail the company and/or damage
    their repudiation by publishing them.

  ERP-System Compromise: >
    As a hacker I want to access the ERP-System in order to steal/modify sensitive business data.
  Database Compromise: >
    As a hacker I want to access the database backend of the ERP-System in order to steal/modify sensitive
    business data.
  Contract Filesystem Compromise: >
    As a hacker I want to access the filesystem storing the contract PDFs in order to steal/modify contract data.
  Cross-Site Scripting Attacks: >
    As a hacker I want to execute Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and similar attacks in order to takeover victim sessions and
    cause reputational damage.
  Denial-of-Service of Enduser Functionality: >
    As a hacker I want to disturb the functionality of the enduser parts of the application in order to cause direct financial
    damage (lower sales).
  Denial-of-Service of ERP/DB Functionality: >
    As a hacker I want to disturb the functionality of the ERP system and/or it's database in order to cause indirect
    financial damage via unusable internal ERP features (not related to customer portal).

security_requirements:
  Input Validation: Strict input validation is required to reduce the overall attack surface.
  Securing Administrative Access: Administrative access must be secured with strong encryption and multi-factor authentication.
  EU-DSGVO: Mandatory EU-Datenschutzgrundverordnung
